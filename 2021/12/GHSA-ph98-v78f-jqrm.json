	"summary": "SQL injection in jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal",
	"details": "### Impact\n\nUsers can provoke SQL injections if they can specify a node name or query.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to version 1.7.4\n\nIf that is not possible, you can escape all places where `$property` is used to filter `sv:name` in the class `Jackalope\\Transport\\DoctrineDBAL\\Query\\QOMWalker`: `XPath::escape($property)`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNode names and xpaths can contain `\"` or `;` according to the JCR specification. The jackalope component that translates the query object model into doctrine dbal queries does not properly escape the names and paths, so that a accordingly crafted node name can lead to an SQL injection.\n\nIf queries are never done from user input, or if you validate the user input to not contain `;`, you are not affected. \n\n### References\n\nNo further references.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal repo](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal/issues)\n",
