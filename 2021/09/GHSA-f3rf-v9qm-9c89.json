	"summary": "Cross-site Scripting in the femanager TYPO3 extension",
	"details": "The extension allows by default to upload SVG files when a logged in frontend user uploads a new profile image. This may lead to Cross-Site Scripting, when the uploaded SVG image is used as is on the website.\n\nNote: If SVG uploads are required, it is recommended to use the TYPO3 extension svg_sanitizer (added to TYPO3 core since versions 9.5.28, 10.4.18 and 11.3.0) to prevent upload of malicious SVG files or to set up a strict Content Security Policy for the destination folder of uploaded images.",
