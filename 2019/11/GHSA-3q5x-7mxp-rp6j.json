	"summary": "Remote code execution via vulnerable Symphony dependecy injection",
	"details": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Magento 2.2 prior to 2.2.10, Magento 2.3 prior to 2.3.3 or 2.3.2-p1. Dependency injection through Symphony framework allows service identifiers to be derived from user controlled data, which can lead to remote code execution.\nAs per [the Magento Release 2.3.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20201126132230/https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/release-notes/release-notes-2-3-3-commerce.html#new-security-only-patch-available), if you have already implemented the pre-release version of this patch (2.3.2-p1), it is highly recommended to promptly upgrade to 2.3.2-p2.\n",
