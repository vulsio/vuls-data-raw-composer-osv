	"summary": "Bypass of sitemp access restrictions",
	"details": "A security bypass vulnerability exists in Magento 2.2 prior to 2.2.10, Magento 2.3 prior to 2.3.3 or 2.3.2-p1. A user with privileges to generate sitemaps can bypass configuration that restricts directory access. The bypass allows overwrite of a subset of configuration files which can lead to denial of service.\n\nAs per [the Magento Release 2.3.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20201126132230/https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/release-notes/release-notes-2-3-3-commerce.html#new-security-only-patch-available), if you have already implemented the pre-release version of this patch (2.3.2-p1), it is highly recommended to promptly upgrade to 2.3.2-p2.",
