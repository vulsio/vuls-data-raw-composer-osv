	],
	"summary": "Information disclosure of source code in SimpleSAMLphp",
	"details": "### Background\n\nThe module controller in `SimpleSAML\\Module` that processes requests for pages\nhosted by modules, has code to identify paths ending with `.php` and process\nthose as PHP code. If no other suitable way of handling the given path exists it\npresents the file to the browser.\n\n### Description\n\nThe check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for uppercase\nletters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server is\nserving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the\nprocessing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead\npresented to the browser.\n\n### Affected versions\n\nSimpleSAMLphp versions **1.18.5 and older**.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in third-party\nmodules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive. However, the attack\nsurface is considered small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp\nserves such content from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on\nWindows.\n\n### Resolution\n\nUpgrade the SimpleSAMLphp installation to version **1.18.6**.\n\n### Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and reported by Sławek Naczyński.",
