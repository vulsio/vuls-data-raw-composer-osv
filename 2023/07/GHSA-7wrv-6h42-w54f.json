	"details": "### Summary\nA player sending a packet can cause the server to crash by providing incorrect sign data in NBT in `BlockActorDataPacket`.\n\n### Details\nThis vulnerability was discovered using the `BlockActorDataPacket`, but other packets may also be affected. The player would seem to just need to send an NBT with an incorrect type to throw this error.\n\n```\n[Server thread/CRITICAL]: pocketmine\\nbt\\UnexpectedTagTypeException: \"Expected a tag of type pocketmine\\nbt\\tag\\CompoundTag, got pocketmine\\nbt\\tag\\ByteTag\" (EXCEPTION) in \"pmsrc/vendor/pocketmine/nbt/src/tag/CompoundTag\" at line 107\n--- Stack trace ---\n  #0 pmsrc/src/network/mcpe/handler/InGamePacketHandler(751): pocketmine\\nbt\\tag\\CompoundTag->getCompoundTag(string[9] FrontText)\n  #1 pmsrc/vendor/pocketmine/bedrock-protocol/src/BlockActorDataPacket(50): pocketmine\\network\\mcpe\\handler\\InGamePacketHandler->handleBlockActorData(object pocketmine\\network\\mcpe\\protocol\\BlockActorDataPacket#220241)\n  #2 pmsrc/src/network/mcpe/NetworkSession(433): pocketmine\\network\\mcpe\\protocol\\BlockActorDataPacket->handle(object pocketmine\\network\\mcpe\\handler\\InGamePacketHandler#190572)\n```\n\n### PoC\nUse a bot or proxy to send a packet when editing a sign. This packet should contain an NBT with incorrect types but correct architecture.\n\n### Impact\nThis makes it possible to shutdown a server for someone who knows how to operate it. As this was discovered in 4.22.1, everyone with at least this version is affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis bug was fixed by 0c250a2ef09627b48aa52302f6cc7e1f2afb70ea in the 4.22.3 and 5.2.1 releases.\n\n### Workarounds\nA plugin may be able to handle `DataPacketReceiveEvent` for `BlockActorDataPacket`, and verify that the `FrontText` tag is a `TAG_Compound`.",
