	"summary": "Silverstripe has Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities inherited from TinyMCE",
	"details": "TinyMCE 4.x is vulnerable to several XSS vectors, which had been patched in later versions. Two of these have been identified as affecting `silverstripe/admin`.\n\nOnly Silverstripe CMS 4 is affected by this issue. It's not possible to upgrade Silverstripe CMS 4 to use a more recent release of TinyMCE without introducing breaking changes. Instead, the security patches that shipped in later releases of TinyMCE have been backported to the TinyMCE version bundled in `silverstripe/admin`.\n\nSilverstripe CMS 5 is not affected by those vulnerabilities because it uses TinyMCE 6.\n\nYou can find more information about the underlying vulnerabilities in those GitHub security advisories:\n\n- [GHSA-5h9g-x5rv-25wg Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5h9g-x5rv-25wg)\n- [GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65 Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65)",
