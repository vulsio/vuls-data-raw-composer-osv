While the specification states that `\\r\\n\\r\\n` is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept `\\n\\n`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in 1.6.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds.\n\n### References\n\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2.4",
