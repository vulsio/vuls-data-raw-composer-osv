	"summary": "formwork Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Markdown fields",
	"details": "### Impact\nUsers with access to the administration panel with page editing permissions could insert `<script>` tags in markdown fields, which are exposed on the publicly accessible site pages, leading to potential XSS injections.\n\n### Patches\n\n- [**Formwork 1.13.0**](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/releases/tag/1.13.0) has been released with a patch that solves this vulnerability. Now the system config option `content.safe_mode` (enabled by default) controls whether HTML tags and potentially dangerous links are escaped. This is configurable as in some cases more flexibility should be given. Panel users should be only a controlled group of editors, which cannot enable the option by themselves, and not a generic group. This mitigates the chance of introducing vulnerabilities.\n- [**Formwork 2.x** (6adc302)](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/6adc302f5a294f2ffbbf1571dd4ffea6b7876723) adds a similar `content.safeMode` system option. Like Formwork 1.13.0, by default HTML tags and dangerous link are escaped. Even if enabled by an administrator, however, `<script>` and other dangerous tags are still converted to text, but secure tags are allowed.\n\n### References\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-35621\n",
