This pull request ensures that the ddtrace.request_init_hook remains bound by the open_basedir INI directive, effectively addressing potential vulnerabilities related to open_basedir restrictions. \nThe update introduces a sandboxing mechanism to isolate the request init hook from errors or exceptions during execution, enhancing the library's stability and preventing adverse impacts on the main script.",
