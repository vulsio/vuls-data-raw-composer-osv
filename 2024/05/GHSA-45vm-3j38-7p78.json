	"summary": "PrestaShop cross-site scripting via customer contact form in FO, through file upload",
	"details": "### Impact\nOnly PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled are impacted, starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0.\n\nThe impact is substantial, when the customer thread feature flag is enabled, through the front-office contact form, a hacker can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin opens the attached file in back office.\n\nConsequence: the script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability is patched in 8.1.6.\n\n### Workarounds\nAs long as you have not upgraded to 8.1.6, a simple workaround is to disable the customer-thread feature-flag.\n\nThank you to Ayoub AIT ELMOKHTAR, who discovered this vulnerability and share it with the PrestaShop team.\n",
