	"details": "The encryption and decryption process were vulnerable against the Bleichenbacher's attack, which is a padding oracle vulnerability disclosed in the 98'.\nThe issue was about the wrong padding utilized, which allowed to retrieve the encrypted content.\nThe OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING version, aka PKCS v1.5 was vulnerable (is the one set by default when using openssl_* methods), while the PKCS v2.0 isn't anymore (it's also called OAEP).\n\nA fix for this vulnerability was merged at https://github.com/Cosmicist/AsymmetriCrypt/pull/5/commits/a0318cfc5022f2a7715322dba3ff91d475ace7c6.",
