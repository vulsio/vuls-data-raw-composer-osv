	"details": "When using the zend-mail component to send email via the `Zend\\Mail\\Transport\\Sendmail transport`, a malicious user may be able to inject arbitrary parameters to the system sendmail program. The attack is performed by providing additional quote characters within an address; when unsanitized, they can be interpreted as additional command line arguments, leading to the vulnerability.\n\n",
