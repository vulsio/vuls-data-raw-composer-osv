	"summary": "October System module has a Reflected XSS via X-October-Request-Handler Header",
	"details": "### Impact\n\nThe X-October-Request-Handler Header does not sanitize the AJAX handler name and allows unescaped HTML to be reflected back. There is no impact since this vulnerability cannot be exploited through normal browser interactions. This unescaped value is only detectable when using a proxy interception tool.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in v3.5.15.\n\n### References\n\nCredits to:\n- [Mayank Mehra](mailto:mayankmehra54@gmail.com)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n",
