	"details": "The `Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\RemoteAddress` class provides features around detecting the internet protocol (IP) address for an incoming proxied request via the X-Forwarded-For header, taking into account a provided list of trusted proxy server IPs. Prior to 2.2.5, the class was not taking into account whether or not the IP address contained in PHP's `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` was in the trusted proxy server list.\n\nThe IETF draft specification indicates that if `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` is not a trusted proxy, it must be considered the originating IP address, and the value of X-Forwarded-For must be disregarded.",
