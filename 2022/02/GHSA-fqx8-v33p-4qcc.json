	"summary": "Cross-site Scripting in enshrined/svg-sanitize",
	"details": "### Impact\nSVG sanitizer library before version `0.15.0` did not remove HTML elements wrapped in a CDATA section. As a result, SVG content embedded in HTML (fetched as `text/html`) was susceptible to cross-site scripting. Plain SVG files (fetched as `image/svg+xml`) were not affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is fixed in `0.15.0` and higher.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is currently no workaround available without upgrading.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Github](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/issues)\n* Email us at [daryll@enshrined.co.uk](mailto:daryll@enshrined.co.uk)\n",
