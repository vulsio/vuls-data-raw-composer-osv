	],
	"summary": "Server-Side Request Forgery and Open Redirect in AllTube Download",
	"details": "### Impact\n\nOn releases prior to 3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured).\n\nThe impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.)\n\n### Patches\n\n3.0.3 contains a fix for this vulnerability.\n(The 1.x and 2.x releases are not maintained anymore.)\n\nThe fix requires applying [a patch](https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/blob/3d092891044f2685ed66c73c870a021bee319c37/patches/youtube-dl-disable-generic.diff) to youtube-dl to disable its generic extractor. If you are using the version of youtube-dl bundled with 3.0.3, it is already patched.\nHowever, if you are using your own unpatched version of youtube-dl **you might still be vulnerable**.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/8913f27716400dabf4906a5ad690a5238f73496a\n* https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30691\n",
