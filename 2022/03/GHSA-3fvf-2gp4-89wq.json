	"summary": "Possibility for Denial of Service by overwriting PHP files with language exports",
	"details": "### Impact\nLaravel Translation Manager didn't check the locale name, which allowed directory traversal when exporting files. The content would be a PHP file returning an array of translations, but this could lead to unexpected results, like denial of service. Access to the Laravel Translation Manager is required, because a new locale would have to be added and published.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 0.6.2 fixes this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nOnly allow trusted admins to publish/edit translations.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager/pull/417\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager\n* Email me (see Github profile)\n\n### Credits\nFound and reported by [Natalia Trojanowska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trojanowskanatalia/)",
